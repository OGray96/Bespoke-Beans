# Bespoke Beans (Project 3)

```
AS A coffee lover who is always in a rush
I WANT a fast pick up coffee website
SO THAT I can put in an order and quickly pick up my coffee on the way into the office
```

Our project uses everything we've learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provided us with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews.

```
Bespoke Beans is a small coffee shop in the heart of Melbourne, serving only the finest, most expensive coffees in town. But don't let that fool youâ€”we know our stuff! We're obsessed with finding the perfect bean and putting it in your cup.
Our name was inspired by two different things: the first is our love for fine clothing and accessories; the second is our belief that good coffee should be treated like an art form, not a commodity. Every cup we serve is hand-crafted to ensure that it meets our standards of quality, which are high.
