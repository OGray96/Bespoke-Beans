                Bespoke Beans is a small coffee shop in the heart of Melbourne,
                serving only the finest, most expensive coffees in town. But
                don't let that fool youâ€”we know our stuff! We're obsessed with
                finding the perfect bean and putting it in your cup. Our name
                was inspired by two different things: the first is our love for
                fine clothing and accessories; the second is our belief that
                good coffee should be treated like an art form, not a commodity.
                Every cup we serve is hand-crafted to ensure that it meets our
                standards of quality, which are high.
              </p>

                Oliver, one of our baristas, has been with Bespoke Beans since
                we opened our doors in 2022. He's passionate about coffee and is
                always willing to help new customers find their perfect cup. He
                takes pride in his work and wants everyone who walks through our
                doors to feel welcome and comfortable.
